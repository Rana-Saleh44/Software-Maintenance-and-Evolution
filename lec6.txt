Software maintenance has unique characteristics:
Constraints of an existing system
Shorter time frame
Available test data

Why Do We Need Models to Manage & Execute Software Maintenance Activities?
 Change, Evolution, system configuration->complicate->maintenance activities.
 software product->released->customer->executable code,
whereas the corresponding “product” within the supplier organization is source code.
Thus, strict control must be kept, otherwise exact source code representation of a
particular executable version may not exist.

Three maintenance models will be explained:
1. Reuse old
2. Simple Staged relatively new
3. Change Mini-cycle still in research

Change Mini-Cycle Model
Software change->may->introduce new requirements or alter the software system if requirements are not correctly implemented.
change mini-cycle evolutionary model  check the figure in slide 5

mini-cycle model consists of five major phases:
1. Change Request (CR): defect report or enhancement request
2. Analyze and plan change: Program comprehension, Impact analysis and ripple effect
3. Implement change: change propagation
4. Verify and validate: code review, regression testing, and execution of new tests
5. Documentation change.

Software Maintenance Standard
 IEEE and ISO have both addressed s/w maintenance processes.
 IEEE/EIA 1219 considers maintenance as a fundamental life cycle process , it
organizes the maintenance process in seven activities :
 problem identification, analysis, design, implementation, system test, acceptance
test and delivery.

 ISO/IEC 14764 describes s/w maintenance as an iterative process for
managing and executing software maintenance activities, which are :
 process implementation, problem and modification analysis, modification
implementation, maintenance review/acceptance, migration and retirement.
