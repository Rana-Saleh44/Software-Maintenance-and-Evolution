Evolution and Maintenance Models

Maintenance as part of the SDLC
req def 3%->preliminary design 5%- detailed design 5%-> implem 7%->testing 15%"all the previous is a develpoment phase"->operations and maintenance 67%"maintenance phase"{Software Maintenance Life Cycle (SMLC)}

Software maintenance has unique characteristics:
Constraints of an existing system
Shorter time frame
Available test data

Why Do We Need Models to Manage & Execute Software Maintenance Activities?
 Change, Evolution, system configuration->complicate->maintenance activities.
 software product->released->customer->executable code,
whereas the corresponding “product” within the supplier organization is source code.
Thus, strict control must be kept, otherwise exact source code representation of a
particular executable version may not exist.

Three maintenance models will be explained:
1. Reuse old
2. Simple Staged relatively new
3. Change Mini-cycle still in research
